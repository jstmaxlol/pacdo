a simple cli utility to shorten pacman syntax.
no dependencies other than pacman, sudo and (optionally) figlet

idk i was bored and started to hate writing 'sudo pacman -S package'
for every package i needed while setting up a new arch install so yeah.

the easiest way to install pacdo is through the AUR package:
* yay    : yay -S pacdo
* paru   : paru -S pacdo
* trizen : trizen -S pacdo
* pamac  : pamac build pacdo
* aurman : aurman -S pacdo

otherwise, stick to manual compiling :)
just 'g++ -o pacdo pacdo.cpp' after 'git clone'ing the repo

pacdo base syntax:
'pacdo verbal/command package'

[ possible verbals/commands ]
pacdo h/H/help                        = shows usage screen
pacdo s/S/install/get/sync package    = installs a package (if found)
pacdo syu/Syu/yolo                    = runs a full-system-upgrade (same as pacman -Syu)
                                        ('pacdo yolo' also parses --noconfirm)
pacdo r/R/remove package              = removes a package
pacdo rq/Rq package                   = removes a package with all their dependancies
pacdo q/Q/query                       = queries pacman database (same as pacman -Q)
pacdo ph                              = shows pacman's usage screen
pacdo contribute/repo                 = opens pacdo's github repo
pacdo u/U/upgrade package             = upgrade a package (if found)
pacdo RemoveDatabaseLock/dbr          = removes db.lck (/var/lib/pacman/db.lck)
                                        warning! only use 'pacdo dbr' if you are 100% sure
                                        there's NO pacman instances running. you have been warned.

developer note: if anyone is interested in this shortened syntax
just hit me up somewhere and i'll make version for other utilsÂ¶
